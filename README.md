I am a learner of the ALX Back-end web development and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search. This is why I started with software engineering, what I am passionate about and what inspires me is applying analytical thinking to complex problems in both veterinary medicine and software engineering . My aim is to merge my medical expertise with cutting edge technology to drive innovation into the veterinary field and thatâ€™s why I would like to work on telemedicine platform for veterinary care.Please prepare a template I can use, which revamps all the sections of the GitHub profile. Enrich this template with HTML markups and compelling format and make it professional. After finishing, please ask me how you can help me making this template more personalized.
